# Welcome to the Client for the News Feed web app

## Notes:
1. **app/config.js contains URL and TTL variables**
 - CACHE_TTL
 - SERVER_URL

2. **CACHE_TTL controls how long cached results will remain valid in local storage**

3. **SERVER_URL points to the Server app**

## Welcome to the app

This is a front-end application that is paired with the "news-server" project. This was made as part of a portfolio made while in Nucamp coding bootcamp. Please feel free to analyze and comment.
